CHAT ROOM BUILT WITH REACT AND FIREBASE

This is the first time I ventured into the backend area, with the massive help of Firebase, to create an app that allows me and my friends to catch up with each other. 
Although this is no way near perfect, I will be improving the UI and the code along the way to make my web app supports more features that are present in normal messaging app (send photos, emojis,...)
